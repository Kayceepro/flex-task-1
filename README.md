## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SCSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I am now able to work with grid and flex and i added shadow to the individual grid item

```html
<div class="grid-purple box"></div>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```css
box-shadow: 3px 2px 2px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
```

### Continued development

as i progress i wish to advance more on the building and making it as much interacrive as it can with css and javasceipt

### Useful resources
