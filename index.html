                    and
                    found it increadibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12weeks was the best - and most
                    grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched carreers, and

                    "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure with some
                    professionals who can help me learn programimg step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                    studentn of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and
                    staff
                    did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and never had to wait for assistance. The agilre team
                    project, particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next levl in a w ay that no
                    tutorial
                    could even have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
                    development
                    experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full stack developer after recieving multiple
